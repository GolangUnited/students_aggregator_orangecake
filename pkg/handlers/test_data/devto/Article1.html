            <p>In this tutorial, we would be creating a Restful API with a practical approach of clean architecture and native Golang without any frameworks.</p>

<p>There are lots of tutorials out there, for Restful API but the issue they are facing is they don't have a clear structure and use various frameworks.</p>

<p>Those tutorials depend on the existence of some frameworks of Golang. With every external framework being used in the project, it comes with great responsibility. I don't have anything against these frameworks, but rather I prefer to minimize the use of external frameworks and stick with standard packages of Golang.</p>

<p>When a beginner starts learning Golang, most of them jump straight away to the famous external frameworks, such as Gin, Beego, Fiber and many more. Frameworks are good to implement something fast, but the main issue is here that beginners are using frameworks without understanding the native approach that Golang provides out of the box. This approach leads to the developer being dependent on the specific framework. If you are sticking with frameworks, what would you do if these frameworks are being deprecated, have bugs or are not being supported anymore? </p>

<p>All of these frameworks use the native Golang codes behind them with an extra layer which makes them frameworks. </p>

<p>So my two cents here is to try to learn standard Golang packages this way you will not get lost in the world of frameworks, as Golang provides most of the required things out of the box.</p>
